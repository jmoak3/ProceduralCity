# ProceduralCity

A basic C++/DirectX 3D engine and test application I made back in 2013.

The engine uses encapsulation to be flexible and portable if anyone felt the need to port it to another platform.

It has a lot of tweakable parameters to control how the buildings look. Heres's a video of it in action:
