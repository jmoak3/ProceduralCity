# ProceduralCity

A basic C++/DirectX 3D engine and test application I made back in 2013.

The engine uses encapsulation to be flexible and portable if anyone felt the need to port it to another platform.

It has a lot of tweakable parameters to control how the buildings look. 

It also has "Cars" that drive around. Heres's a video of the city + cars in action:
